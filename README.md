# beam_code
Rust utilities for working with bytecode from Erlang .beam files

**Mainly deprecated in favor of [core_erlang](https://github.com/hansihe/core_erlang). After implementing this, I realized that compiling from Core Erlang instead of BEAM bytecode would make a more robust and easier to maintain solution, so I went for that instead.**
